# UFOs
## Overview of Project:
This project is meant to offer a mean to mine data regarding UFO sightings and display them in a specific layout:
- Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration, and Comments.\
Users, when interacting with the application, would enter their search requirements and submit their requests. The application must filter the raw data and present the results onto the main page.
The data set of UFO sightings had been provided to us.

## Analysis and Challenges:
Using my knowledge of javascript, D3, internet resources I focused on delivering a simple code that meet the requirement for this project. It's been challenging and rewarding.
I have genuily attempted to structure the code in way to handle all possible interactions with a user. Below are the results.

## Results:
1) A user starts the application, the interface is to display all recorded UFO sightings [All sightings](https://github.com/RichardYDepestre/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/page-load_default.png) 
2) A user enters valid criteria for which there are no data. The appliction is to display a message that should read: "*** No data match your search criterion(a) ***". [No data found](https://github.com/RichardYDepestre/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/valid-criteria_no-data.png) \
2.1) The same message would display should there be a type in one of the input fields [Type-No data](https://github.com/RichardYDepestre/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/typo_no-data.png)
3) Data results are tailored to the criteria entered [Parial criteria](https://github.com/RichardYDepestre/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/some-criteria.png)
4) Data results are refined when a user input all valid search criteria [Refined Data Result](https://github.com/RichardYDepestre/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/all-criteria_narrowed-lists.png)

## Conclusion:
This challenge helped me appreciate the possibilities of Web Development. It also highlighted the challenges that lay ahead as I foray into learning more of the web developmemnt tools.
